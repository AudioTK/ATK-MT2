*MT2* is a free Open Source plugin emulating the MT2 pedal.

== Usage

Here is how the parameters interact with the plugin:

[square]
* *Distortion* is the distortion level your want
* *Low level* is the amount of low frequency content
* *High level* is the amount of high frequency content
* *Mid level* is the amount of mid frequency content
* *Mid frequency* is the central frequency content

There are a few advanced parameters that are not available on a regular MT2 pedal and thus are not accessible through the UI:

[square]
* *Low Q* changes the Q parameter of the low-tone bell filter
* *High Q* changes the Q parameter of the high-tone shelf filter
* *Mid Q* changes the Q parameter of the mid-tone bell filter
